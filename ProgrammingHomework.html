	<p>'The Rise of Skywalker', the ninth episode of the Star Wars saga, which was born in 1977 thanks to the mind and work of the filmmaker George Lucas, is the last great cinematographic event of 2019 and of the decade; The executives of Disney, a company that currently has the rights to the story after acquiring LucasFilm in 2012, warned that the film will mean an end to the story we know so far, so we will have to say goodbye forever to endearing characters like Leia Organa , Chewbacca, C3PO, and R2D2 (and others who previously died, such as Han Solo and Luke Skywalker).</p>
